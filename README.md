This calculator allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can also calculate the square of a number by entering the number and clicking the "xÂ²" button. Additionally, you can use the "%" button to perform modulo operation, which calculates the remainder of a division operation. Use the "DEL" button to delete the last digit entered and the "C" button to clear the display.
